        Lasagna is a wide, flat sheet of pasta. Lasagna can refer to either the
        type of noodle or to the typical lasagna dish which is a dish made with
        several layers of lasagna sheets with sauce and other ingredients, such
        as meats and cheese, in between the lasagna noodles.

            ground beef.
          </li>
          <li>
            Onion and garlic: An onion and two cloves of garlic are cooked with
            the meat to add tons of flavor.
          </li>
          <li>
            Tomato products: You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of
            tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.
          </li>
          <li>
            Sugar: Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness and
            enhance the flavor of the sauce.
          </li>
          <li>
            Spices and seasonings: This lasagna recipe is flavored with fresh
            parsley, dried basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds,
            and black pepper.
          </li>
          <li>
            Lasagna noodles: Use store-bought or homemade lasagna noodles.

            Cheeses: Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make this lasagna
            extra decadent.
          </li>
          <li>
            Egg: An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze out of the
            lasagna when you cut into it.
